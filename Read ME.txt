## Overview

This backend system built with PHP for the react app. It includes various functionalities such as user authentication and data management

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- PHP (version X.X or higher)
- MySQL (or any compatible database system)
- Apache or Nginx web server
- Composer (for dependency management)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd [repository-folder]
    ```

2. **Move the files to the hotdocs folder**:
    Copy all the project files into your server's `hotdocs` folder. Ensure the directory structure remains intact.

    ```sh
    cp -r * /path/to/hotdocs/
    ```

## Database Setup

### Important Warning
**Ensure you import the database correctly to avoid any issues with the application.**

1. **Create a new database** in your MySQL server:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE gebeya;
    ```

2. **Import the database schema** and data:
    ```sh
    mysql -u [username] -p [database-name] < /path/to/hotdocs/database.sql
    ```
    Replace `[username]` with your MySQL username and `[database-name]` with the name of your database.

3. **Update the database configuration** in the project:
    Edit the `config.php` (or similar configuration file) to match your database credentials:
    ```php
    define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
    define('DB_USER', '[username]');
    define('DB_PASS', '[password]');
    define('DB_NAME', '[database-name]');
    ```

## Usage

To run the project, navigate to `http://localhost/hotdocs/` in your web browser. Ensure your web server is configured to serve files from the `hotdocs` directory.
